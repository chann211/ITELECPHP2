					Hi there! My name is Michael Christian G. Navarro im 19 years old.Im currently staying in Barangay Sambag II Urgello Cebu City.But my home address is in Sta. Clara Naga Zamboanga Sibugay.Im a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student im at my 4th year.To be honest IT is not my first choice but things happened 
					and i ended up taking this course.Im not really a god when its comes to programming but i can persevere to learn new langauges.All these years in college has been tough but its an enjoyable experienced for me.

					Im also a fan of some animes but i hardly watch them at this point because of my tight schedule.I also follow NBA and my favorite team is the Los Angeles Lakers since the Shaq-Kobe era up to this point.Even though American Football is not the famous all over Asia i still watched some games of it if i have free time,my favorite NFL team is the Dallas Cowboys.I was also hooked up to Lawn Tennis at some point in my high school im a big fan of Rafael Nadal.Im also a big Gamer i played a lot of video games such as Dota2,CSGO,TeamFortress2,Ragnarok2,Nba2k,FIFA,Madden and a lot more games.I watched also a lot of movies from different genre such as romcom,horror,comedy and wars.Life can be hard sometimes but i learned from my grandpa that you just need to struggle to reach the peak of your interest and dreams.Strive hard for the things you want because great things will not happen to the people who just wait for it.
