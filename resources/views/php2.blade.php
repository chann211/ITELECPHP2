					PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly. PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. This confuses many people because the first word of the acronym is the acronym. This type of acronym is called a recursive acronym.
		\
					This course provides an overview of the PHP web programming language as a facility in developing dynamic and interactive web applications. Emphasis is on the Model-View-Controller architecture. Topics include PHP web configuration and setup, web forms, user controls, server controls, web services and database integration.
